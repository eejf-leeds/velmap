VELMAP is a MATLAB code that estimates surface velocity and strain-rate fields through a joint inversion of InSAR and GNSS data. It can also be used to reference InSAR line-of-sight velocities to GNSS reference frames.
JF has updated the code to improve its performance for large-scale calculations (e.g., in Tibet and the Alpine-Himalayan Belt).
